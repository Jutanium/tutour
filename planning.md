When you create a code link, it gets added to the code links library in the content editor.

You can click on a code link to insert it into the markdown [editor].
There are two ways to include a code link:
- As a Markdown link, e.g. [Click me](my-code-link). This will pull up the code link in the file editor when the link is clicked.
- On its own line, using this syntax: (my-code-link): text
This will both link that line to the code link, and add an _annotation_ to the code link that shows up when you hover over it in the file editor
